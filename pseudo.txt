GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


// Want to apply the date to the current day id in the DOM (it is a 'p' element) - complete

//Add the rest of the time blocks in the HTML. - complete

// Need to add create a reference to all of the time blocks so that corresponding color is displayed based on the time of day (gray for past time blocks, red for current, green for upcoming).

//create a function that will capture the values placed within the timeblocks.
//Within that function, add the values placed in the timeblocks to localStorage (this will also include calling the readEventsFromStorage function that will be equal to a variable we will create called 'events') - reference mini-project 5 solved file.




//

//Need to add an event listener to the events within the time blocks to enable users to enter information there.  Need to capture those values so they can be stored in localStorage.

// Need to add an event listener to the save button so that each value typed in the  input within a time block can be stored in localStorage. Remember to use jQuery syntax

// Need to setItems in localStorage.
